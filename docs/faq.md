# Frequently Asked Questions
## Why are my MCP/Radios screens black?
When starting from cold and dark, the MCP and Pedestal backlighting is turned to minimum setting. This rotary knob also controls the screen brightness of the MCP and radios. 
To turn on the radios, turn the AISLE STAND PNL rotary to the full right setting; It's located at the back right of the pedestal.

To turn on the MCP, turn the GLARE PNL rotary to the full right setting; it's located on the bottom-left of the overhead panel.

## Does the 787 support MacOS?
Yes, it does! You'll need to update it to 1.2.10 or later to get support

## The 787's fuel consumption is far too low
Make sure you have "Experimental flight model" enabled in the x-plane settings. The flight model is built for, and tested with the latest flight dynamics from LR. We don't provide support for the non-experimental flight model.

## How do I update my 787?
With the **787**: Aviator's Edition comes the ability to auto-update your aircraft using the SkunkCrafts updater. Minor updates (1.0.x) will only be shipped through these means.

The SkunkCrafts updater can be found [here](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/forums/topic/144828-updater-download-page-v22-available/).

You'll find the changelog in your aircraft's folder.

Missing the config file? Download it [here](https://docs.magknight.org/img/skunkcrafts_updater.zip). You'll need to place it in your aircraft's root directory.

## What does VATSIM mode do?
VATSIM mode enables intergration with the [VATSIM network](https://vatsim.net). It enables SELCAL identification, radio uplink using contact-me messages, and some other uplink-related features. *VATSIM mode only works with X-Squawkbox; due to a lack of dataref availablilty, the Swift pilot client, and IVAO clients are not supported*

## Does the 787 work in VR?
We don't directly support VR, and haven't made any special arrangements to allow it to work. Many users have however reported that the plane does work in VR.
We reccomend these modifications if you'd like to use the plane in VR:
